\title{Determine if timing metrics are early, late, or in range}
\usage{
early_or_late(value, early_value, late_value, days_in_water_year)
}
\description{
Properly rolls over the calendar at 365 days, but can tell you if a metric is early, late, or "within range"
based on the modeled early_value, modeled late_value, and the actual value. It returns "within range"
if the value is between early_value and late_value. If not, it splits the distance between late_value and
early_value in two, rolling over at the end of the calendar year, and assesses if the value is closer to
the late_value (then returns "late"), or the early value (then returns "early")
}
